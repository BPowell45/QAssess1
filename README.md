# QAssess1
Welcome to my quiz bowl!
This quiz is based off of the courses i'm taking this semester

To take the quiz bowl you go to 'app.py' and select run, in which it will ask you which course you'd like to answer questions from. From there it will go question by question asking you and then displaying if you were correct or incorrect
The 'read.py' program will show you category by category what is in each one, it will ask you which youd like to see and then it will display all of the question and answers, then it will prompt you if youd like to see another and repeat
'create.db' is the file that contains all of the questions and answers and the program that created the database in which everything is stored in and pulled from

Thank you :)
